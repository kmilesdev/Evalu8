You are acting as a Senior SaaS Software Architect and QA Engineer reviewing a newly generated full-stack application called Evalu8.

Evalu8 is an AI-powered hiring platform that simulates real workplace scenarios and evaluates candidate readiness before the first interview.

Please perform a full internal audit of the entire codebase and application architecture that was generated from the original prompt.

✅ STEP 1 — FEATURE VERIFICATION

Review the entire application and confirm whether the following have been correctly implemented:

Frontend Pages (React)

Recruiter:

Signup page

Login page

Dashboard page

Job creation page (/jobs/new)

Job detail page (/jobs/:jobId)

Candidate report page (/jobs/:jobId/candidates/:appId)

Candidate:

Intake page (/apply/:jobToken)

Interview simulation page (/apply/:jobToken/interview)

Completion page (/apply/:jobToken/complete)

Backend API (Express)

Recruiter routes:

POST /api/jobs

GET /api/jobs

GET /api/jobs/:jobId

GET /api/jobs/:jobId/applications

GET /api/applications/:appId/report

PATCH /api/applications/:appId/status

Candidate routes:

GET /api/public/job/:jobToken

POST /api/public/applications

POST /api/public/applications/:appId/message

POST /api/public/applications/:appId/submit

Database Tables (Supabase)

Confirm the existence and structure of:

profiles

jobs

applications

messages

evaluations

flags

Check that:

job_token is generated uniquely

simulation_type defaults to "problem_solving"

seniority_level defaults to "mid"

num_questions defaults to 8

time_limit_minutes defaults to 15

Auth + Security

Confirm:

Supabase Auth is implemented for recruiters

Candidates are not required to authenticate

Row Level Security is enabled for:

jobs

applications

Recruiters can only access jobs they own

AI Services

Confirm the following files exist and function correctly:

/server/services/interviewAgent.js

/server/services/evaluationAgent.js

Verify:

Interview agent asks one question at a time

Evaluation agent returns structured scoring JSON

Transcript is retrieved and evaluated on submission

Application status updates to "completed"

🔍 STEP 2 — CODEBASE HEALTH CHECK

Check for:

Missing environment variables

Broken API connections

Unused routes or components

Inconsistent naming

Potential async/await issues

Error handling gaps

State management problems

SQL schema mismatches

Fix any issues found.

🚀 STEP 3 — IMPACT RECOMMENDATIONS

Now review the product from a SaaS perspective and suggest improvements that would make Evalu8 more impactful and enterprise-ready, such as:

UX flow improvements

Scoring reliability improvements

Interview consistency

Data retention or audit logging

Exportable candidate reports

Candidate progress indicator

Recruiter analytics

Multi-organization support

Anti-cheating logic

Admin notes or pipeline status tags

Implement any recommended improvements that:

Do NOT drastically increase complexity

Improve real-world usability

Make the product more demo-ready for recruiters

📦 FINAL OUTPUT

Provide:

A summary of what was missing (if anything)

Any bugs or structural issues fixed

Any improvements added

Updated files if modified

Do not remove core functionality.

Evalu8 must still:

Allow recruiters to create jobs

Allow candidates to complete AI simulations

Provide evaluation reports on completion
